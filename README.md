## **Polynomial Regression**

For understanding Polynomial Regression, let's first understand a polynomial.
Merriam-webster defines a polynomial as:
"_A mathematical expression of one or more algebraic terms each of which consists of a constant multiplied by one or more variables raised to a non-negative integral power (such as a + bx + cx^2)"._
Simply said, poly means many. 

So, a polynomial is an aggregation of many monomials(or Variables).
A simple polynomial equation can be written as:
- **y = a+bx + cx^2+...+nx^n+...**

So, Polynomial Regression can be defined as a mechanism to predict a dependent variable based on the polynomial relationship with the independent variable.

In the equation,
- **洧녽 = 洧녩+洧녪洧논+洧녫洧논^2+...+洧녵洧논^洧녵+...**
 
the maximum power of 'x' is called the degree of the polynomial equation. For example, if the degree is 1, the equation becomes
洧녽=洧녩+洧녪洧논
 
which is a simple linear equation. if the degree is 2, the equation becomes
- **洧녽 = 洧녩+洧녪洧논+洧녫洧논2**
 
which is a quadratic equation and so on.
